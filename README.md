This HR platform was built during one of my computing modules with my teammates in NTU.

It has a separate login process for either Managers / employees. 
Contains a database for Manager - Employee relationship. 

It aims to improve the HR process in a company by enabling employees to:
1) Apply Leaves
2) Apply claims
3) Speak to an automated chatbot for assistance

It also enable Managers to:
1) Approve / Reject Leaves
2) Approve / Reject Claims

A user guide was also made to allow user to seamlessly use the application in python.
